## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition
**How might we help Singaporean millennials lower their carbon emissions by turning everyday spending into clear, actionable awareness, while adding minimal effort to their routine?**

---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **ðŸ’³ Transaction-Based Tracking**
  - Estimates carbon emissions from expenditures.
  - Builds awareness through everyday spending.
  - Doubles as an expense tracker to make logging less tedious and more useful.

- **ðŸ“Š Seasonal Pattern & Carbon Handprint Planning**
  - Forecasts seasonal spending spikes from historical data.
  - Recommends sustainable alternatives or offset actions.
  - Makes sustainability *proactive* rather than reactiveâ€”fitting busy lifestyles.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Value Proposition
- Prioritises **intrinsic awareness** over pure **offsetting** or **gamified rewards** (e.g., Klima, Aerial, Commons).  
- **Reduces friction** vs. traditional trackers that require tedious granular inputs (e.g., utility kWh/bills).  
- Integrates sustainability into **day-to-day financial habits**â€”visible, accessible, and practical.  
- **Forecasting** educates users with alternatives and builds gradual, sustainable habits.  
- Makes sustainability **achievable** and **relatable**, lowering resistance to adoption.
